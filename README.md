This is small web application which given a topic or subject in the news does sentiment analysis using natural language processing to create datasets and display the sentiment on a given topic.

It uses the following libraries:

- Vue.JS (to manage the front-end),
- retext-sentiment (for NLP sentiment analysis),
- [insert RSS feed library here]

Roadmap
We plan to:

- Connect it to Firebase for authentication and data storage
- Provide user with feed of news sources they are interested in
- Chart data of sentiment on topic across media and for each media source over time
