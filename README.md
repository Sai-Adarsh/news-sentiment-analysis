### Demo 
![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sai-Adarsh/IBMHackathon/master/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif)

This is a small web application that, given a topic or subject in the news, performs sentiment analysis using natural language processing to create datasets and display the sentiment on a given topic.

### Uses
- Vue.js (to manage the front-end).
- retext-sentiment (for NLP sentiment analysis).
- [insert RSS feed library here].

### Roadmap
We plan to:
- Connect it to Firebase for authentication and data storage.
- Provide users with a feed of news sources they are interested in.
- Chart data of sentiment on a topic across media and for each media source over time.
